                <p class="quote">"The white fathers have told us: 'l think, therefore I am.'' But the Black mother within each one of us—the poet inside—whispers in our dreams: 'I feel, therefore I can be free.' Learn to use what you feel to move you toward action. Change, personal and political, does not come about in a day, nor a year. But it is our day-to-day decisions, the way in which we testify with our lives to those things in which we say we believe, that empower us. Your power is relative, but it is real. And if you do not learn to use it, it will be used, against you, and me, and our children. Change did not begin with you, and it will not end with you, but what you do with your life is an absolutely vital piece of that chain. The testimony of your daily living is the missing remnant in the fabric of our future."</p>

                <p class="quote">“They told me it was a hallucination, this waking dream I want for all of us, but now I know the truth. In a world where capitalism as usual makes complicit in drowning the planet, we are the ones who are already dolphins, the psychics, the visionaries. We could trust ourselves. Our adaptable foreheads were not made to be caged; we deserve the restful freedom to evolve, to -- as D'atra Jackson said at the North Caroline Emergent Strategy Immersion -- ‘surrender to your dreams’"</p>

                <p class="quote">Whether it’s been years, months or weeks since you’ve released work or visited the altar of your creative practice, it’s always the right time to return. Returning to our way of knowing, being and breathing reminds us of the possibility always available to us inside the non-linear loop of creative practice. If fear is excitement without breath, love lets the oxygen in. This radical self-love makes burn out much more difficult to take hold and easier to spot before it begins. Returning to desire is a practice of recharge, not depletion. Inside our breathwork, the spacious possibility that creative practice cultivates, we get to create worlds that nurture our wholeness and attract resources, relationships and opportunities we couldn’t imagine would find their way to us. But first, we must find our way back to ourselves…
